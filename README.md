# allBus-HAT-for-Raspberry-Pi

## **Power Funtions:**  
The HAT is supplied with 5V via screw terminals and can handle 3A current.  
a push button and an LED can be connected to the HAT on the port provided for this purpose.  
  
The button triggers a Mosfet circuit that supplies the Pi with power, the LED lights up as soon as the Pi starts.  
If the button is pressed again the LED starts blinking for 3 seconds, if pressed again during this time the Pi will initiate a proper shutdown and then reset the Mosfet, the Pi is now completely powerless.  
A long press of the button leads to a hard disconnect of the power supply.  

In addition, two GPIO are led out which can be used, for example, to control a relay for the main power supply of a 3D printer (Attention: this would require a downstream circuit that switches the load with a transistor). 





## **Bus Features:**  
-CAN Bus on SPI0 (e.g. to connect the Pi internally with the MCU)   
-UART (e.g. to connect the Pi internally with the MCU)  
-SPI1 (e.g. for input shaper. Note: it still needs to be tested)  
-I2C (e.g. for input shaper)  



## **Installation:**  
coming soon
